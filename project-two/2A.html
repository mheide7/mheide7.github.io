<p> <strong>Board Games</strong> lower blood pressure and help relax you. Not only will board games allow you to focus, but they will help you strengthen relationships with those you are playing with!
<strong>Car Rides </strong> (or going for a drive) sometimes just getting out of the room can help adjust your mood. The scenery can help relax and boost your brain waves as well!
<strong>Painting</strong> allows you to fully commit and engage yourself into an activity. Not only is it fun, it reduces stress and is a creative outlet.
